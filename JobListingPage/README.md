<h1>Job Listing Page with Filter Feature.</h1>

This is one of the challenges found in [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/job-listings-with-filtering-ivstIPCt). All of the style and design guidelines found there too. This page is an example of a job listing page with the feature to list the jobs based on the role/level/languages/tools that you have.
The way the filter works is you need to click one of the tags you want to be on the filter and it will shown in the filter bar above and it will filter out the job list that unrelated to that tags.
